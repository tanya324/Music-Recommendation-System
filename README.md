# ðŸŽµ Music-Recommendation-System ðŸŽµ

## Project Overview: 
This project demonstrates an innovative and efficient music recommendation system/engine built using Python. This project uses machine learning techniques to analyse user preferences and suggest songs.

  Imagine you have a HUGE playlist of songs, and you want a <b>smart buddy</b> that can suggest new songs based on what you like. That's exactly what this <b>MUSIC RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM </b> does! 
<br>Let's break down what we'll do in this project.

<h2> ðŸŽ¯ Step - 1 Collecting Music Data </h2>
<p>
  Before making recommendations, we need a list of songs.
Think of it as making a music diary where we write down song details like:
  <ul>
    <li>Song Name ðŸŽµ</li>
    <li>Artist Name ðŸŽ¤</li>
    <li>Genre (Rock, Pop, Jazz, etc.)</li>
    <li>Features (Is the song fast or slow? Is it happy or sad?)</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<br>

<h2>ðŸŽ¨ Step 2: Cleaning the Data</h2>
<p>
  Before using our song data, we need to clean it up:
  <ul>
    <li>Remove missing information (if a song has no artist name, we delete it).</li>
    <li>Convert messy data into an easy format (like organizing songs into a table).</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<br>

<h2>ðŸ§  Step 3: Finding Similar Songs (Recommendation Techniques)</h2>
<p>
   How does the music buddy know what to recommend? There are two common ways:
  <ol>
    <li>Content-Based Filtering (Matching Song Features): 
    <p> If you like Believer (high energy, fast tempo), it finds other songs with similar features.</p></li>
    <li> Collaborative Filtering (User-Based Recommendations):  
    <p>It checks what songs other people like who have similar taste as you</p></li>
  </ol>
</p>
<br>

<h2>ðŸ’» Step 4: Creating a Simple Website for Users</h2>
<p>Now, we need a way for people to type a song name and get recommendations.<br>For this, we use Flask (a simple way to build websites in Python).</p>
